# name.wadewalker.tutorial
An Eclipse RCP tutorial project that shows how to use Java OpenGL (JOGL) in a way suitable for scientific or engineering applications. To use, just clone my two projects https://github.com/WadeWalker/com.jogamp.jogl and https://github.com/WadeWalker/name.wadewalker.tutorial from GitHub, then import them into an empty Eclipse workspace.

This tutorial is explained in more detail on my blog at https://wadeawalker.wordpress.com/2010/10/09/tutorial-a-cross-platform-workbench-program-using-java-opengl-and-eclipse/.
